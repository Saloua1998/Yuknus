### Yuknus website ###

# Brief Description #
Customers can buy Yuknus(fluffy fantasy bears) on this website.
They can also customize their own Yuknu and send this request to my client.
My client will then sketch this idea and send this via mail back.
When the Customer is satisfied with this idea a payment request will be send.
The customer can also see upcoming events (e.g. Halloween, Castlefest).

# Motivation #
I'll make this project, because my client does her business via instagram.
The customers have to scroll through her posts to see which Yuknu they like.
They also can't see quickly which yuknu are available and which ones not.
I want to simplify this proces by making a website where she can sell all her Yuknus.
The customers can easily see which Yuknu are available.
They can also see which ones have been sold and send a request to make another one of those.
This way the selling proces is easier for my client and the buying process is easier and faster for the customers.
